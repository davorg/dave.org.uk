title: Newspaper web feeds
---

Many years ago, this page contained an index of all of the web feeds
published by national UK newspapers. It was incredibly difficult to
keep up to date and I didn't have the time to give it the attention
it required.

Also, outside of a tiny tech bubble, RSS never really took off in the
way it should have done and for a few years now people have been
proclaiming that
<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=rss+is+dead">RSS is dead</a>.
So I've decided to remove the page.
