We can't find that page anywhere.

We've even looked down the back of the sofa.

But the fact that you were looking for it has been registered and we'll
see what we can do about the problem.

<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }

  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      gtag('event', 'page_404', {
        'event_category': 'error',
        'event_label': document.location.pathname,
        'page_location': document.location.href,
        'page_title': '404 Not Found',
        'referrer': document.referrer
      });
    }, 500); // Small delay to ensure GA4 is fully loaded
  });
</script>
