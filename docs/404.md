We can't find that page anywhere.

We've even looked down the back of the sofa.

But the fact that you were looking for it has been registered and we'll
see what we can do about the problem.

<script>
  // Ensure GA4 is loaded before firing event
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }

  // Send a custom event to GA4 when the 404 page loads
  gtag('event', 'page_404', {
    'event_category': 'error',
    'event_label': document.location.pathname,
    'page_location': document.location.href,
    'page_title': '404 Not Found',
    'referrer': document.referrer  // Capture the referring page
  });
</script>
