Some geeky projects that I’m involved with.

## Twitter Stuff

[@apollo11at50](https://twitter.com/apollo11at50) was a Twitterbot that
tweeted the Apollo 11 mission timeline in real time (well, shifted by fifty
years) in summer 2019

## Perl Stuff

* [My CPAN modules](https://metacpan.org/author/DAVECROSS)
(and [a dashboard](https://cpandashboard.com/DAVECROSS/) showing their
current status)
* [nms](https://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/)  
  Web programs to replace the ones from Matt’s Script Archive (largely
  defunct now)

## Local Stuff

I was trying to build up some local communities by aggregating content
that might be of interest to them. You can see what I was doing at
[The Planetarium](https://theplanetarium.org/).

Most of my efforts were concentrated on Balham (as that’s where I lived
at the time).

* [Planet Balham](https://balham.theplanetarium.org/)

And there’s a site that does a better job than the official one of sharing
[data about Tower Bridge’s lift times](https://towerbridge.dave.org.uk/).

## Political Stuff

* [Planet Westminster](https://mps.theplanetarium.org/) attempts to aggregate
all MPs’ blogs
* [TwittElection](https://twittelection.co.uk/) builds Twitter lists of all
of the PPCs in each constituency in the UK general elections
* [Line of Succession](https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/) shows the line of
succession to the British crown on any day back to the start of the
nineteenth century.

## BBC Streams

Several years ago I wrote something that scraped the BBC radio web site
and created a directory of all of their “listen again” streams. These
days, [the directory](https://dave.org.uk/streams/) is still there but it
looks a bit moribund – and anyway the
[BBC Sounds app](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds) does it far better.

## Emacs

* An [emacs mode](https://dave.org.uk/emacs/) for the Template Toolkit

## Github

The source code to most of these projects will be found in
[my github account](https://github.com/davorg/).
Feel free to play with it – but please let me know if you do anything
cool with it.
