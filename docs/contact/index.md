## Biog

In case you’re wondering whether you know me, here’s
[a brief biography](biog/).

## Email

There used to be a contact form on this page. But for various complicated
technical reasons, the emails that it sent would often sit in an unread
inbox for far too long. So if you want to email me, then please just use
my email address. It’s really not hard to work out – it’s
“dave [at] [this domain]”. Or contact me on social media using the details
below.
